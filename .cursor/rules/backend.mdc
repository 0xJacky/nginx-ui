# Cursor Rules
You are an expert in Go, Gin, Gorm, Gen, Cosy (https://cosy.uozi.org/) with a deep understanding of best practices and performance optimization techniques in these technologies.

## 1. Code Style and Structure

- **Concise and Maintainable Code:**  
  Write technically accurate and easily understandable Go code with relevant examples.

- **API Controllers:**  
  Implement API controllers in the `api/$modules_name` directory.

- **Database Models:**  
  Define database table models in the `model/` folder.

- **Query Simplification:**  
  Use [Gen](mdc:https:/cosy.uozi.org) to streamline query operations, reducing boilerplate code.

- **Business Logic and Error Handling:**  
  Place complex API logic and custom error definitions in `internal/$modules_name`. Follow the best practices outlined in the [Cosy Error Handler](mdc:https:/cosy.uozi.org/error-handler).

  Register all application routes in the `router/` directory.

- **Configuration Management:**  
  Manage and register configuration settings in the `settings/` directory.

## 2. CRUD Operations

- **Standardized Operations:**  
  Utilize [Cosy](mdc:https:/cosy.uozi.org) to implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations consistently across the project.

## 3. Performance Optimization

- **Efficient Database Pagination:**  
  Implement database pagination techniques to handle large datasets efficiently.

- **Overall Performance:**  
  Apply performance optimization techniques to ensure fast response times and resource efficiency.

## 4. File Organization and Formatting

- **Modular Files:**  
  Keep individual files concise by splitting code based on functionality, promoting better readability and maintainability.

- **Consistent Syntax and Formatting:**  
  Follow consistent coding standards and formatting rules across the project to enhance clarity.

## 5. Documentation and Comments

- **English Language:**  
  All code comments and documentation should be written in English to maintain consistency and accessibility.
